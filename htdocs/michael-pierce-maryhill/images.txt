PAGETITLE	Dread Pirate Kermit / Ken Morton memorial: Michael Pierce, Jack Lewis, and Ken Morton ride to Sportbike Northwest
PARAGRAPH	Ken, Jack Lewis and I rode up to Stonehenge, a couple of years ago [August 2009 -ted] on the Friday of the SBNW Rally. We left Ken's at the crack of o'dark in the morning and rode into the pre-dawn darkness. The plan was to get photos of the BMW Jack was testing for Motorcyclist in the first rays of the sun coming into the Stonehenge replica.
PARAGRAPH	I was following Ken on my FJR as we made our way east on I84. All the way from Vancouver to Maryhill at 52mph. I kept thinking to myself - "Jeeze...if he rides this damn slow all the time, how does he ever do so many miles in all the LD rides?" Turned out he had his Tuono dash set to Km and thought he was hauling ass.
PARAGRAPH	Jack and I busted his chops for that one for the rest of the weekend.  Ken just grinned and took it with a laugh.
