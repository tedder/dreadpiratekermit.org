Ken, Jack Lewis and I rode up to Stonehenge, a couple of years ago on
the Friday of the SBNW Rally. We left Ken's at the crack of o'dark in
the morning and rode into the pre-dawn darkness. The plan was to get
photos of the BMW Jack was testing for Motorcyclist in the first rays
of the sun coming into the Stonehenge replica.

I was following Ken on my FJR as we made our way east on I84. All the
way from Vancouver to Maryhill at 52mph. I kept thinking to myself -
"Jeeze...if he rides this damn slow all the time, how does he ever do
so many miles in all the LD rides?" Turned out he had his Tuono dash
set to Km and thought he was hauling ass.

Jack and I busted his chops for that one for the rest of the weekend.
Ken just grinned and took it with a laugh.
