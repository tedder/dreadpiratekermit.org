SECTION	How to help
PARAGRAPH	<ul><li>Send him a postcard or short letter.<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/samfans-list">Join the samfans mailing list</a> so we can coordinate who is telling him about current events, see if he is asking for anything, and so on.<li>Send Sam a postcard or letter.<li>Donate spending money to Sam's account.</ul>
PARAGRAPH	As Ken said: "Sam has a great attitude, admitting and accepting he was at fault and deserves to be where he is. That doesn't necessarily make it easy being there. Occasionally I have asked people to send birthday cards or what ever, and Sam tells me they always raise his spirits, and make that day suck a little less. I think it would be cool to have as many people as possible send Sam a postcard from anyplace they happen to be. Corner grocery, state park, National Park, where-ever. You don't need to write anything pithy or awe inspiring (but you can) just a quick 'Hi Sam, someone is thinking about you today!' is more than enough."
SECTION	What happened?
PARAGRAPH	<a href="story.pdf">In Sam's words</a>: I have told this story dozens of time. I don't enjoy it, but I don't hide it, either. It's a part of who I am and how I cam to be who I am today. I believe in the truth, even when it's ugly. If at times my telling of this story seems clinical and matter-of-fact, it's not because I'm emotionally detatched. I tell this story with shame.
